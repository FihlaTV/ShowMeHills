create a csv file with columns;
id, name, longitude, latitude, height, link, itemtype

Then use sqlite3 to 
a) update version number
b) clear out existing data
c) import csv file

~\Workspace\ShowMeHills\ShowMe\ShowMeHills\assets>sqlite3 hillsv1.db
SQLite version 3.7.12 2012-05-14 01:41:23
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> delete from mountains;
sqlite> update dbversions set ver=6;
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .separator "~"
sqlite> .import planet-121017-peaks_unit_fixed.csv mountains
sqlite> vacuum;
sqlite> .quit

Remember to update mDatabaseVersion in HillsDatabase.java to match the version set in the database above,otherwise the database will keep trying to reload and no hills will be shown.

if you're going to import OSM first and then want to merge in British Hills Database, you have two options:

1) delete the british hills from OSM to avoid duplicates. So I import OSM first, then do this;

delete from mountains where longitude between -12 and -2.960816 and latitude between 59.651034 and 61;
delete from mountains where longitude between -2.960815 and 1.367798 and latitude between 50.519248 and 61;
delete from mountains where longitude between 1.367797 and 2.098389 and latitude between 51.094323 and 61;

then import British Hills. I'm hoping those regions are ok, but it's not rigourously tested (as usual!)

2) If you are familiar with Oracle databases, follow the instructions in how_to_merge_datasets_oracle.txt
to prepare a single CSV file with OSM and BIH datasets merged and most duplicates removed. Use this CSV
file in the SQLite ".import" command above instead.
