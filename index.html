          <h3>Hello, and welcome to the Show Me Hills site. ShowMeHills is an Android augmented reality application which overlays the names of mountains over a camera view.</h3>

<p><br><br>
This application started out as a personal challenge to create an Android application, based on a suggestion from my father while we were climbing the Cnicht mountain in Wales. It proved easier than I expected to produce a more or less working application, but the instability of the compass on my HTC Desire HD began to drive me nuts. The application relies on your GPS location and a good compass bearing. If either are out then the overlaid names won't match the viewed hills.
<br><br>
The GPS worked perfectly (mostly), but the compass was woefully inadequate and was frequently more than 20 degrees away from it's correct bearing. I realised that I could never put this application on Android Market (or Play Store whatever its name is now), even for the minimal amount of money. In fact as a free application it might even do worse since free apps will always be downloaded by people who are just curious and then slam it in the ratings despite not costing them a penny.
<br><br>
So I decided to make it open source in the hope that will help other application developers, plus an outside chance someone will contribute a bit of source to make the compass perfect (or I buy a new phone). I will probably still put it on Android market as a free app just to draw attention to the project.
<br><br>
Feel free to try it out. I suspect it's got plenty of oddities in it as it was my first ever Android application. Hopefully I'll also be able to add more to this site to establish space to get in contact with me and discuss improvements etc.
<br><br>
There is a separate <a href="http://www.showmehills.com">project page</a> where I'll probably add a forum (or something), but don't forget the <a href="https://github.com/nikcain/ShowMeHills/wiki">wiki</a> page too!</p>
